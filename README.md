## Introduction
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This repository serves as a guide for beginners to understand the basic concepts and components of Kubernetes.

## Pods
Pods are the smallest and simplest Kubernetes objects. They represent one or more containers deployed together on the same host. In this section, you'll learn how to create and manage pods in Kubernetes.

## Deployments
Deployments manage the lifecycle of pods in Kubernetes. They enable you to declare the desired state of your application, and Kubernetes ensures that the actual state matches the desired state. Learn how to use deployments for managing your applications.

## Services
Services enable communication between different parts of your application within a Kubernetes cluster. They provide a consistent way to access pods, regardless of their underlying IP addresses. Explore how services work in Kubernetes and how to create them.

## Ingress
Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster. It provides HTTP and HTTPS routing to services based on hostnames and paths. Discover how to set up and configure ingress resources for your applications.

## ConfigMap
ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable. Learn how to use ConfigMaps to inject configuration data into your pods.

## Secrets
Secrets store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys, in a Kubernetes cluster. They provide a way to securely manage and distribute this data to your applications. Find out how to create and use secrets in Kubernetes.

## StatefulSets
StatefulSets are used for managing stateful applications in Kubernetes. They provide stable, unique network identifiers, and persistent storage for each pod. Learn how to deploy and manage stateful applications using StatefulSets.

## DaemonSets
DaemonSets ensure that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a pod. They are useful for deploying system daemons like log collectors, monitoring agents, or storage daemons on every node. Discover how to use DaemonSets to deploy and manage these types of applications.

## StorageClass
StorageClasses provide a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of storage they offer. They are used to provision dynamic persistent volumes in Kubernetes. Explore how to define and use StorageClasses to dynamically provision storage for your applications.

## PersistentVolumes
PersistentVolumes (PVs) are storage resources in Kubernetes that have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the PV. Learn how to define and manage PersistentVolumes in your cluster.

## PersistentVolumeClaims
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) are requests for storage by a user. They act as a request for storage and describe the desired characteristics such as access mode and size. Discover how to create and manage PersistentVolumeClaims to dynamically provision storage in your applications.
