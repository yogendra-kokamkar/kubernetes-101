## Introduction
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This repository serves as a guide for beginners to understand the basic concepts and components of Kubernetes.

## Pods
Pods are the smallest and simplest Kubernetes objects. They represent one or more containers deployed together on the same host. In this section, you'll learn how to create and manage pods in Kubernetes.

## Deployments
Deployments manage the lifecycle of pods in Kubernetes. They enable you to declare the desired state of your application and Kubernetes ensures that the actual state matches the desired state. Learn how to use deployments for managing your applications.

## Services
Services enable communication between different parts of your application within a Kubernetes cluster. They provide a consistent way to access pods, regardless of their underlying IP addresses. Explore how services work in Kubernetes and how to create them.

## Ingress
Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster. It provides HTTP and HTTPS routing to services based on hostnames and paths. Discover how to set up and configure ingress resources for your applications.

## ConfigMap
ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable. Learn how to use ConfigMaps to inject configuration data into your pods.

## Secrets
Secrets store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys, in a Kubernetes cluster. They provide a way to securely manage and distribute this data to your applications. Find out how to create and use secrets in Kubernetes.
